I successfully completed the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, which helped me enhance my cloud skills and build a serverless web application. Here's what I achieved:

## ✨ Key Highlights:

- **Backend**: Created an API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to capture visitor counts.
- **CI/CD**: Implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- **Security**: Managed IAM roles and policies to secure the AWS resources.
  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
